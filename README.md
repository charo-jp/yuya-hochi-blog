## Motivation
Before creating this project, I was familiar with CommonJS but never experienced building an application that can be used in the real world. Therefore, I decided to make a blog website where I can show my skills.

Another motivation is to publish clear explanations of technology such as programming. Throughout my self-study, I spent hours trying to understand one concept. I hope that the articles I have published help others to understand without going to other sources.

## Purpose
There are multiple purposes for this project. Here is a list of purposes:
- Learn how to use Gatsby
- Learn how to manage files
- Learn Website design
- Learn Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Apply all the things above to the project
- Improve my react skill

### How I managed files
As the number of files increases, it is becoming more difficult to manage files. File management comes in handy for this situation. For this project, I organised files into folders by what they do. For example, the Layout folder contains files that compose the basic structure of the website: header and footer. This allows developers to find the file they are looking for easily.
